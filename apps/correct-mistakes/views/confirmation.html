  <p>We are currently experiencing very high volumes of requests. It is taking significantly longer than usual to resolve requests and it may take up to 20 working days.</p>
  <p>We investigate each case individually and in date order. We will respond to you as soon as possible.</p>
  <p>Please do not chase for updates as this reduces ability to respond in a timely manner.</p>
  <p>We will review the information you have provided and let you know if a replacement BRP is required.</p>
  <p>If you need to report errors on multiple BRPs, you must report the issues with each BRP separately. We will then advise you what to do next.</p>
