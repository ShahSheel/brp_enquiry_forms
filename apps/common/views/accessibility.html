  <p>This accessibility statement applies to the following services:</p>

    <li>navigate most of the website using speech recognition software</li>
    <li>listen to most of the website using a screen reader</li>
  </ul>

  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>some common personal details like name, date of birth and address may not autocomplete with the user’s details - this does not meet WCAG success criterion 1.3.5 (Identify Input Purpose)</li>
    <li>not all pages identify the language used as English - this does not meet WCAG success criterion 3.1.1 (Language of Page)</li>
    <li>some text on the final confirmation page is not sufficiently colour contrasted against the background - this does not meet WCAG success criterion 1.4.3 (Contrast - minimum)</li>
    <li>typeaheads are announced as ‘disabled’ or ‘read only’ even though they are not - this does not meet WCAG success criterion 4.1.2 (Name, Role Value)</li>
    <li>the guidance read out on how to correctly populate date fields is incorrect - this does not meet WCAG success criterion 3.3.2 (Labels and Instructions)</li>

  <p><strong>Non-accessible content found in ‘Report a lost or stolen BRP’</strong></p>

  </ul>

  <p><strong>Non-accessible content found in ‘My BRP has not been delivered’</strong></p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

  <p><strong>Non-accessible content found in ‘Nominate someone to collect your BRP’</strong></p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>some radio buttons do not have unique IDs, which may make it harder for assistive technologies to accurately interpret text - this does not meet WCAG success criterion 4.1.1 (Parsing)</li>
